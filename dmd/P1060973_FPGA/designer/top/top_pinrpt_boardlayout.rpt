-"DNC" Do Not Connect
-"Vref" The pin is set as a VREF pin
-"NC" No Connection - No connection to die. These pins can be used for board level signal routing by the designer.
-"Probe A" Programmed as output for probeA
-"Probe B" Programmed as output for probeB
-"Due to Probe" Probe is on, therefore bank voltage must be 2.5V or 3.3V
-"Open Drain" Tribuff IOs where the D is connected to 0 and the E is routed.
-* Libero configures unused User IO (GPIO, HSIO) as: Input Buffer Disabled, Output Buffer Tristated, Week Pull-up.
-** Even if the IO bank is not being used, users must connect this VDDIx to a rail that meets the specifications of this IO bank.
-*** Tie-offs to VSS can be ganged to a single 10K Ohm resistor. User can also add more 10K Ohm resistors if it eases board level routing.
-**** Package Power Parasitics are lumped together and will be reported only on one power ball line per power type.
-***** The embedded PCIe controller subsystem (PCIESS) is available only within Quad_0 "XCVR_0" Lanes.  See "UG0685: PolarFire FPGA PCI Express User Guide" for more information on the embedded PCIE capabilities and its usage.
-****** Preferred clock connectivity should be referenced in "UG0684: PolarFire FPGA Clocking Resources User Guide" before completion of PCB design.
